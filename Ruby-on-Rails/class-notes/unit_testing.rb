# Because Ruby is a dynamic language, editor will not pick up typos
# Refactor with confidence that you didn't break anything
# Documentation for developers

# Uses Test::Unit - member of XUnit family
# Basic idea - extend Test::Unit::TestCase
# prefix method names with test_

# Can use setup() and teardown() methods for setting up behavior that
# will execute before every test method
